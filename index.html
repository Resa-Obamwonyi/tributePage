                <p>Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an American singer and actress. 
                    She was cited as the most awarded female artist of all time by Guinness World Records and remains 
                    one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 200 million records sold worldwide. 
                    Houston released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have been certified 
                    diamond, multi-platinum, platinum, or gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
                     Her crossover appeal on the popular music 
                    charts as well as her prominence on MTV influenced several female African-American female artists.</p>

                <p>Houston began singing in church as a child and became a background vocalist while in high school. 
                    With the guidance of Arista Records chairman Clive Davis, she signed to the label at the age of 19.
                    Her first two studio albums, Whitney Houston (1985) and Whitney (1987), both reached number one on
                    the Billboard 200 and are among the world's best-selling albums of all time. She remains the only
                    artist to have seven consecutive number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, from 
                    "Saving All My Love for You" in 1985 to "Where Do Broken Hearts Go" in 1988.</p>

                <p>Houston made her screen acting debut in the romantic thriller film The Bodyguard (1992). 
                    She recorded six songs for the film's soundtrack, including "I Will Always Love You", which 
                    received the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and became the best-selling single by a woman 
                    in music history. The soundtrack album received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year; 
                    it remains the best-selling soundtrack album in history. Houston starred and recorded 
                    soundtracks for two other high-profile films, Waiting to Exhale (1995) and The Preacher's 
                    Wife (1996), with the latter's soundtrack becoming the best-selling gospel album in history.</p>

                <p>Following the critical and commercial success of My Love Is Your Love (1998), Houston renewed her contract
                    with Arista for $100 million. However, her personal struggles began overshadowing her career, and the 
                    album Just Whitney (2002) received mixed reviews. Her drug use and a tumultuous marriage to singer 
                    Bobby Brown were widely publicized in media. After a six-year break from recording, Houston returned 
                    to the top of the Billboard 200 chart with her final studio album, I Look to You (2009). 
                    On February 11, 2012, Houston was found dead at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. 
                    The coroner's report showed that she had accidentally drowned in the bathtub, with heart disease
                    and cocaine use as contributing factors. News of her death coincided with the 2012 Grammy Awards
                    and was featured prominently in international media.</p>
